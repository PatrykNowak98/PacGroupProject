## Project plan
- The planned project is an android application that presents pizza recipes. The user can choose its type, size, which verifies the amount of ingredients. (mySQL database or database on Google Firebase). All data is fetched from the database and displayed to the user in a new tab in the form of a recipe. The application is to make it easier for the user to choose a dish and make cooking more enjoyable through quick access to many recipes instead of tedious searching on websites. It is to attract customers fascinated by the art of home baking pizza. The application will be written in Android Studio in Kotlin. This enables code consistency, which will make it easier for all employees to work on the project. The planned database to use is mySQL because of free access and a familiar environment for developers creating this project.
